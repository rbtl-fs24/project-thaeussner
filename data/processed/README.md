## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

    The data was obtained using a Google Forms survey. Questions were split into three sections, about 1) general info, 2) their habits with single-use cups and 3) their opinions and further thoughts on a campus-wide ban on single-use cups, the results of which can be found in the published report. Over the span of nine days from 2024-05-21 to 2024-05-29, students were asked on campus or online to fill out the questionnaire. The answers were automatically gathered in Google Sheets and from there converted to csv and rds using /R/01-data_download.R.

2.  Methods for processing the data: All data processing was done using Posit Cloud (RStudio) and R with the tidyverse package. Data download was completed with the googlesheets4 package.

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: Data can be found on Github or whereever this folder is relocated to in the future. Data is in both .csv and .rds format. The final report is a published .html file and can be viewed here: <https://rbtl-fs24.github.io/project-thaeussner/>
